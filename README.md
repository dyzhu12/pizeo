### Pizeo

My first solo Arduino project; used this to learn basic circuits and navigating the Arduino UNO. Based on the Ruggie Kickstarter campaign -- didn't think it was worth 80 dollars. So I made my own Ruggie with an Arduino UNO, some piezo parts, and a bath mat.


Ruggie = $80

Pizeo = $35
 - $25 (Arduino)
 - ~$10 (piezo parts/wires/breadboard)
 - $0 (some ole unused bath mat)
